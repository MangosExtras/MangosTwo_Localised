By Kel\'Thuzad$BThe roots of the Scourge are sewn in the folly of all races. Our rise to power is the product of the sins of those who mean our end. The so called \'heroes\' of the land fall before us by resorting to a measure of our ideals to bring forth their envisioned victory. Their victory is a vehicle to the realization that without resorting to what they define as deplorability to achieve it, we would have overcome them instead. In both outcomes, win or lose, the Scourge invariably wins. When this is recognized, submission to our will is inevitable.
