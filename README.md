# MangosTwo Localisation Project

This is a culmination of over a years work to generate a full localisation process and files for Mangos.

### Features

Rather than an all or nothing system for localisation, the languages can be chosen individually

Current support will include the following:
* Korean
* French
* German
* Spanish
* Spanish (Sourth American)
* Chinese
* Taiwanese
* Russian

Plus the following, even though the client does not natively support it (See "Using the Translated Locale on a different language client than the Locale" below):
* Italian

### How to use it

Eventually it will become part of the main install database scripts, but for now it's a case of manually applying the updates.

1) run the following SQL script:

    `1_LocaleTablePrepare.sql`

This will populate the localised tables with empty entries ready for the language pack.

2) Import the language pack you want from \Translations\<Language>

The language pack currently consists of 6 files:

    <Language>_Creature.sql
    <Language>_Gameobject.sql
    <Language>_GossipMenu.sql
    <Language>_Items.sql
    <Language>_PageText.sql
    <Language>_Quest.sql


The 6 files ending in `_missing.sql` are entries that need to be translated.

### Using the Translated Locale on a different language client than the Locale

1) If you wish to run the localised text in a different language client i.e. Italian Locale using an English client, run these scripts in order:

    `1_LocaleTablePrepare.sql`
    `2_Add_NewLocalisationFields.sql`
    `3_InitialSaveEnglish.sql`

2) Then Import the language pack you want from \Translations\<Language>

The language pack currently consists of 6 files:

    <Language>_Creature.sql
    <Language>_Gameobject.sql
    <Language>_GossipMenu.sql
    <Language>_Items.sql
    <Language>_PageText.sql
    <Language>_Quest.sql
    
3) Then run the remaining script
    `A_replace_BaseEnglish_with_<Language>.sql`

3a) Should you want to revent the changes, just run:
    `B_replace_BaseEnglish_with_English.sql`
